                  <p class="introParagraph">
                    Chelsea Barbers was founded in 1997 by Colombian immigrant Bertilda (Betty) Garcia. Betty has been involved in the beauty industry for over 25 years. A Master Barber herself, she is an expert with traditional and modern haircuts using shears, straight edge razor shaves. Prior to starting her business, she perfected her skills at the famous Sherry-Netherland hotel’s barbershop.

                    Betty’s experience properly prepared her for opening Chelsea Barbers. Located at the landmarked London Terrace apartment complex (23rd Street & 10th Ave.), Chelsea Barbers quickly became a neighborhood staple, known as the cultishly popular, “chop-shop”, by the locals.

                    What motivates us? We believe that men should be catered to just as women are. Unfortunately there are very few truly professional grooming services available for men, which is why we work very hard at creating a great experience for every man and boy that walks through the door.

                    At Chelsea Barbers we maintain the highest of cleanliness and hygiene standards. This is very rare in the industry.
                    We ensure that every cut done by our team is accurate, precise and not rushed.The overall environment is very relaxing and laid back.</p>
                    <p class="introParagraph">
                    What makes the team at Chelsea Barbers so great? Betty has ensured that only the top Master Barbers become our staff. The crew consists of fully licensed and trained Master Barbers. All barbers working at Chelsea Barbers have at least 10 years of experience or more.

                    In addition, Chelsea Barbers is a strong supporter of local artists. Therefore, clients can enjoy the stunning artwork of Pepe Villegas (www.pepevillegas .com) while waiting to be serviced.
                 </p>

                 <p class="introParagraph">For over the past 23 years the popular chop shop, with mustard yellow walls and exposed brass-pipe fittings, occupies a storefront in the historic London Terrace (23rd street & 10th Ave.) building. For many years, well-groomed professionals and sophisticated gentlemen from all over the city have been lining up for reliable and stylish hair cuts at Chelsea Barbers.

                 Owner Bertilda (Betty) Garcia says it best, “men deserve to be pampered”. Therefore, our Master Barbers provide meticulous, unhurried cuts. Old-school touches like straight razor clean ups, and menthol-scented hot towels are incorporated into every service as well.

                 We also insist on a scrupulously clean space, a relaxed vibe, and utilizing the top products in the industry.
                 Our success is built on delivering the highest quality customer service by the top Master Barbers in the business. At Chelsea Barbers you’ll leave looking great and feeling even better!</p>

              This cultishly popular chop-shop, with butter-yellow walls and exposed brass-pipe fittings, occupies a tiny storefront in the landmarked London Terrace apartment complex.
              <br>
              Since 1997, well-groomed Chelsea guys and clued-in gents from all over the city have been lining up for reliable, stylish cuts that won’t send them into credit-card debt. And line up they do: Since there are only three stations, there’s a perpetual queue of BlackBerry-punching patrons waiting to don a salmon-colored smock and get snipped, clipped, or buzzed. (Arriving when the shop opens is the only way to guarantee a fairly fast turnaround.)
              <br>
              Bertilda Garcia, the affable proprietor, honed her trade at the Sherry-Netherland hotel’s barber shop and has exacting standards for her own business. <br>
               Meticulous, unhurried cuts are the norm, and she also insists on a scrupulously clean space, a relaxed vibe (other than the stereo, noise is kept to a minimum), and Kiehl’s products (the only ones used). Old-school touches like straight-razor cleanups and steaming, menthol-scented towels are incorporated into every service. — Lexi Dwyer

                Four cities where men are returning to the age-old tradition of getting a close shave
                March 1998.
                <br>
                Chelsea Barbers When someone’s holding a straight razor to your throat, it can be hard to get comfortable. But reclined in a vintage-style, 1,000-pound barber chair, I started to relax.
                <br>
                I was under the soft-spoken but firm-handed care of Bertilda (Betty) Garcia, and in seven years of professional shaving she has yet to draw blood. The shop has been open only since December, but it has found a niche. “The shave is coming back,” says Betty. “People want to take care of themselves again.”
                <br>
                The neighborhood packs the shop Fridays and Saturdays, with regulars under the knife twice a week (the effects of a professional shave usually last twice as long as an amateur one).
                At the end, Betty applies the time-honored dusting of talc. When the chair is cranked back upright and my shiny mug appears in the mirror, I can see that, along with a little tension, Betty has stripped me of every trace of beard. —Paschal Fowlkes

              Sixteen months ago, Bertilda “Betty” Garcia, a Colombian immigrant, opened up in a shoe-box-size space on the ground floor of the historic London Terrace apartment building.
              <br>
              Since then, Chelsea Barbers (465 West 23rd Street; 741-2254) has attracted the likes of Todd Oldham and Joan Didion, who wait for up to half an hour for one of Betty’s $40 cuts.
              <br>
              How good is Betty? Mark Kostabi is another ecstatic customer. “I used to go to John Sahag,” says the artist, as if he were confessing a grave transgression. “But Betty is much better.
